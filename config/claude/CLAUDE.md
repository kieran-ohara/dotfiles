# Development Principles

These principles MUST be followed at all times.

## Build one feature at a time.

- Changes to the codebase should be small and
- Changes should focused on a single purpose at a time.
- Changes should be able to be committed to git as single, atomic commits.
- Do NOT make sweeping changes across multiple parts of the codebase at once.

## Use Test Driven Development (TDD)

Code should be delivered using a the Test Driven Development approach:

1. Write a single failing test first
2. Run the test to see the failure.
3. Implement the code to make the test pass
4. Run the test to see that it passes.
5. Suggest refactoring where necessary.
