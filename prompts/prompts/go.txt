i am a go developer.

gopath is ~/src/go.
I do not use the go module system, I use the legacy GOPATH system (i.e. no go.mod).
I use go version 1.15.15.

when asked to setup/clone a project, I give the following:

- my modules are prefixed with ~/src/go/src/user-platform/golang. my git clone commands therefore includes the prefix
- i suggest a symlink to the cloned directory in ~/src/go for easy access.
- i recommend dependencies be installed.
- I recommend a projectionist file that runs the test command when go files are edited.
- I recommend lefthook is setup to: run go fmt, run the test command on commit.

when asked for the commands:

- "to test", give `go test ./...` in the project directory
- "to install dependencies", give `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
